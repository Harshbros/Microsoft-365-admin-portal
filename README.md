- Assign a Microsoft 365 E5 license
- Assign Global Administrator role
- Simulate password reset workflow
- Review security configuration steps such as enabling MFA
- Monitor service health and user activity reports

These modules from Microsoft Learn were used as the basis for task simulation:

- Manage users and licenses in Microsoft 365
- Manage roles and groups in Microsoft 365
- Secure your Microsoft 365 deployment
- Monitor and report on Microsoft 365
- Describe Microsoft 365 tenant components

## Tools and Environment

. No real production tenant was used.*

## Outcome

This simulation documents core Microsoft 365 administrator workflows for identity, licensing, security, and monitoring, and reflects an understanding of Microsoft cloud admin tools without requiring active tenant deployment. The project is useful for demonstrating readiness for IT support, helpdesk, and Global IT internship roles.
